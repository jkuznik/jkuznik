## ☁️ My AWS Journey

I have been actively improving my skills with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** by building and deploying applications in the cloud.  

- 🖥 **EC2** → launched and configured virtual servers for testing environments and proof-of-concept deployments.  
- 🐳 **ECS & ECR** → containerized Spring Boot applications, pushed images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry, and orchestrated services in Elastic Container Service (Fargate).  
- 🔐 **Security Groups** → managed inbound/outbound rules smoothly to ensure both application availability and security best practices.  
- 📦 **S3 + CloudFront** → hosted static websites and integrated CDN for faster global delivery.  
- 🔑 **IAM** → worked with roles and policies to follow the principle of least privilege.  
- 📊 **CloudWatch** → monitored logs and metrics to better understand application behavior in the cloud.  

👉 These experiences helped me gain a strong foundation in deploying and operating applications on AWS, and I am continuously learning more about cloud-native design and cost-optimization.
